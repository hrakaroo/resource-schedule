## Resource Schedule

At one point I was doing a fair bit of Java Swing development and decided
I wanted to create a system to schedule resources.  A resource could be
anything and the idea (I think) was that you could view in one page all
the resources you needed and figure out when they were all free.

Looking at the notes and documents it looks like I was still learning 
Maven at the time.  I believe I abandonded this project because I switched
jobs and wasn't using Java Swing as much and I became interested in 
Java Fx.
